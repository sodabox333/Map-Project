		<h1> Trump Might Slash Food Stamps;  These PA Counties With High Food Stamps Enrollment Voted For Him Anyway </h1>
		<h2><i> Some pockets of rural Pennsylvania had over three quarters of voters cast their ballots for Trump. Many people in these counties also depend on public benefits like food stamps to afford groceries, and Trump may make it harder to access these programs.</i></h2>

			Trump’s upcoming administration might move forward with plans to cut food stamps and other benefits as laid out in <a href= "https://www.project2025.org/"> Project 2025</a>.  His first administration attempted to cut food stamps benefits, which would have caused at least 2 million Americans to lose <a href= "https://mathematica.org/news/new-research-analyzes-state-level-impact-of-usda-proposal-to-end-snap-broad-based-categorical"> access</a> to support with groceries.  
		</p>

			Pennsylvania, an important <a href="https://www.usnews.com/news/elections/articles/the-2024-swing-states-pennsylvania-could-sway-the-2024-election"> swing state</a> in the election, ultimately went for Trump, who was most popular in the central part of the state.
		</p>	
		<p>	
			In a number of central Pennsylvania counties over 75% of voters casted their votes for Trump. Census data shows that some PA counties–such as Clearfield, Armstrong and Clarion–also have high enrollment in the federal food stamps program, also known as SNAP, or the <a href="https://www.fns.usda.gov/snap/supplemental-nutrition-assistance-program"> Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program</a>. 
		</p>	
		<p>
			
			Gina Plata-Nino, SNAP Deputy Director at the Food Research and Action Center, said that the food stamps program is already precarious. “We're experiencing a lot of hunger still, since the pandemic. One of the issues during the election is that people were like, ‘grocery prices are high,’ so any potential cuts to an already very fragile system will have detrimental effects,” she said. “People who may be cut from SNAP go to food banks and food banks are at capacity.”

		</p>	
		<p>
			A 2019 federal report showed that over a quarter of working adults had <a href="https://aspe.hhs.gov/reports/people-participate-social-safety-net"> received a public benefit</a> such as food stamps or Medicaid that year.
